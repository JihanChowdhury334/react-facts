# ReactFacts

Learning project: a single-page React site with a navbar, logo, and fun facts list — built to practice **React fundamentals** (components, JSX, props, styling, Vite).

## 🚀 Features
- Navbar with React logo and project title  
- Main section with a heading and a list of fun facts about React  
- Responsive layout and styling with Flexbox  
- Background image integration  
- Clean separation of components (`App`, `Navbar`, `Main`)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React 19 (RC)  
- Vite  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- CSS3

## 📈 Learning Purpose
This project helped me practice:  
- Creating functional React components  
- Organizing a small component-based project structure  
- Using JSX to render content dynamically  
- Styling components with external CSS  
- Setting up and running a React project with Vite
